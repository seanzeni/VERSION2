# Purpose:
#     Fixed-width mainframe export formatter to meet REXX program needs.
#
# Used By:
#     Exporter
#
# Notes:
#     Keep record layout changes isolated here.
#
# Output:
#     Record (Line in file, set to RECORD_SIZE length buffer)
#     (COL-START, LENGTH) Data
#     (0, 8) Element Name
#     (9, 8) Element Type
#     (18, 4) TeamLead ID
#     (23, 20) Bundle ID
#     (46, 4) Subsystem
#     (51, 8) System
#     (60, 5) Environment [MAIN1,DEVL1,QUAL1,PROD1]
#     (66, 8) CCID/Effort/Project
#     (75, 113) Application (from inventory)
#     (113, 2) "NN" Added to end of comment line
#     (115, 150) Filled with SPACES for now.
